Codebook that describes the data, the variables and transformations performed to clean up the data

Data

tidy_dataset.txt is a txt file that is created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE
The first row contains variables that can be found in the next section.

Transformations to clean up the data

The data were cleaned with the following steps:
1. The training and the test sets were merged.
2. Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were made.
3. Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set
4. The data set was labeled with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4 independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
